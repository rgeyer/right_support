  # Implementation concepts: Create a policy that selects an endpoint and sticks with it.
  #
  # The policy should:
  # - iterate through each endpoint until a valid endpoint is found;
  # - continue returning the same endpoint until it is no longer valid;
  # - re-iterate through each endpoint when it's endpoint loses validity;
  # - return an Exception if it performs a complete iteration though each endpoint and finds none valid;
