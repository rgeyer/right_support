  class NoProvider < Exception; end
  
  #
  # A wrapper for the rest-client gem that provides timeouts that make it harder to misuse RestClient.
  #
  # Even though this code relies on RestClient, the right_support gem does not depend on the rest-client
  # gem because not all users of right_support will want to make use of this interface. If one of HTTPClient
  # instance's method is called and RestClient is not available, an exception will be raised.
  #
  #
  # HTTPClient is a thin wrapper around the RestClient::Request class, with a few minor changes to its
  # interface, namely:
  #  * initializer accepts some default request options that can be overridden
  #    per-request
  #  * it has discrete methods for get/put/post/delete, instead of a single
  #    "request" method
  #  * it supports explicit :query and :payload options for query-string and
  #    request-body, and understands the Rails convention for encoding a
  #    nested Hash into request parameters.
  #
  # == Request Parameters
  # You can include a query-string with your request by passing the :query
  # option to any of the request methods. You can pass a Hash, which will
  # be translated to a URL-encoded query string using the Rails convention
  # for nesting. Or, you can pass a String which will be appended verbatim
  # to the URL. (In this case, don't forget to CGI.escape your string!)
  #
  # To include a form with your request, pass the :payload option to any
  # request method. You can pass a Hash, which will be translated to an
  # x-www-form-urlencoded request body using the Rails convention for
  # nesting. Or, you can pass a String which will be appended verbatim
  # to the URL. You can even use a binary String combined with a
  # suitable request-content-type header to pass binary data in the
  # payload. (In this case, be very careful about String encoding under
  # Ruby 1.9!)
  #
  # == Usage Examples
  #
  #   # Create an instance ot HTTPClient with some default request options
  #   @client = HTTPClient.new()
  #
  #   # Simple GET
  #   xml = @client.get 'http://example.com/resource'
  #
  #   # And, with timeout of 5 seconds...
  #   jpg = @client.get 'http://example.com/resource',
  #     {:accept => 'image/jpg', :timeout => 5}
  #
  #   # Doing some client authentication and SSL.
  #   @client.get 'https://user:password@example.com/private/resource'
  #   
  #   # The :query option will be encoded as a URL query-string using Rails
  #   # nesting convention (e.g. "a[b]=c" for this case).
  #   @client.get 'http://example.com', :query=>{:a=>{:b=>'c'}}
  #
  #   # The :payload option specifies the request body. You can specify a raw
  #   # payload:
  #   @client.post 'http://example.com/resource', :payload=>'hi hi hi lol lol'
  #
  #   # Or, you can specify a Hash payload which will be translated to a
  #   # x-www-form-urlencoded request body using the Rails nesting convention.
  #   # (e.g. "a[b]=c" for this case)
  #   @client.post 'http://example.com/resource', :payload=>{:d=>{:e=>'f'}}
  #
  #   # You can specify query and/or payload for any HTTP verb, even if it
  #   # defies convention  (be careful!)
  #   @client.post 'http://example.com/resource',
  #     :query   => {:query_string_param=>'hi'}
  #     :payload => {:form_param=>'hi'}, :timeout => 10
  #
  #   # POST and PUT with raw payloads
  #   @client.post 'http://example.com/resource',
  #     {:payload => 'the post body',
  #      :headers => {:content_type => 'text/plain'}}
  #   @client.post 'http://example.com/resource.xml',
  #     {:payload => xml_doc}
  #   @client.put 'http://example.com/resource.pdf',
  #     {:payload => File.read('my.pdf'),
  #      :headers => {:content_type => 'application/pdf'}}
  #
  #   # DELETE
  #   @client.delete 'http://example.com/resource'
  #
  #   # retrieve the response http code and headers
  #   res = @client.get 'http://example.com/some.jpg'
  #   res.code                    # => 200
  #   res.headers[:content_type]  # => 'image/jpg'

  # A very thin wrapper around RestClient::Request.execute.
  #
  # === Parameters
  # type(Symbol):: an HTTP verb, e.g. :get, :post, :put or :delete
  # url(String):: the URL to request, including any query-string parameters
  #
  # === Options
  # This method can accept any of the options that RestClient::Request can accept, since
  # all options are proxied through after merging in defaults, etc. Interesting options:
  # * :query - hash containing a query string (GET parameters) as a Hash or String
  # * :payload - hash containing the request body (POST or PUT parameters) as a Hash or String
  # * :headers - hash containing additional HTTP request headers
  # * :cookies - will replace possible cookies in the :headers
  # * :user and :password - for basic auth, will be replaced by a user/password available in the url
  # * :raw_response - return a low-level RawResponse instead of a Response
  # * :verify_ssl - enable ssl verification, possible values are constants from OpenSSL::SSL
  #     * OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE (default)
  #     * OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE
  #     * OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
  #     * OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
  # * :timeout and :open_timeout - specify overall request timeout + socket connect timeout
  # * :ssl_client_cert, :ssl_client_key, :ssl_ca_file
  #
  # === Block
  # If the request succeeds, this method will yield the response body to its block.
