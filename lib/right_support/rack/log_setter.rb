require 'logger'

module RightSupport::Rack
  # A Rack middleware that logs information about every HTTP request received and
  # every exception raised while processing a request.
  #
  # The middleware can be configured to use its own logger, but defaults to using
  # env['rack.logger'] for logging if it is present. If 'rack.logger' is not set,
  # this middleware will set it before calling the next middleware. Therefore,
  # RequestLogger can be used standalone to fulfill all logging needs, or combined
  # with Rack::Logger or another middleware that provides logging services.
  #
  # @deprecated this class will be removed in RightSupport 3.0, please do not use it
  class LogSetter
    # Initialize an instance of the middleware. For backward compatibility, the order of the
    # logger and level parameters can be switched.
    #
    # === Parameters
    # app(Object):: the inner application or middleware layer; must respond to #call
    # logger(Logger):: (optional) the Logger object to use, defaults to a STDERR logger
    # level(Integer):: (optional) a Logger level-constant (INFO, ERROR) to set the logger to
    #
    def initialize(app, options={})
      @app    = app
      @logger = options[:logger]
      warn "#{self.class.name} is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0, please refrain from using it"
    end

    # Add a logger to the Rack environment and call the next middleware.
    #
    # === Parameters
    # env(Hash):: the Rack environment
    #
    # === Return
    # always returns whatever value is returned by the next layer of middleware
    def call(env)
