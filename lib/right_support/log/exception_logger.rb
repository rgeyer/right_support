module RightSupport::Log
  # A logger that prepends a tag to every message that is emitted. Can be used to
  # correlate logs with a Web session ID, transaction ID or other context.
  #
  # The user of this logger is responsible for calling #tag= to set the tag as
  # appropriate, e.g. in a Web request around-filter.
  #
  # This logger uses thread-local storage (TLS) to provide tagging on a per-thread
  # basis; however, it does not account for EventMachine, neverblock, the use of
  # Ruby fibers, or any other phenomenon that can "hijack" a thread's call stack.
